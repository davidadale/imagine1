                  <h2>Volunteers Needed!</h2>
                  <p>Be a part of One Family by contributing a few minutes of your time to help build our home!  All of imagine1.org started in our imagination, and came to life with a lot of careful planning and hours of hard work (thanks to our web designer, David!).  However, we can use all the extra help we can get. Email us today at info@imagine1.org and let us know how you can help in the following ways.</p>
                  <h2>Translators</h2>
                  <p>If you can help translate content on the imagine1.org site, please let us know by sending an email to info@imagine1.org. We are building this site without taking contributions so we cannot pay you but every member who joins by reading your translation will be a part of One Family thanks to you.</p>

                      <p>Every day in every interaction every member of One Family can be an ambassador for change. This can be as simple as casual conversations, but to create lasting social change, we must reach our children. To get there we need help in three ways:<p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>Can you help us develop a presentation for 12 to 14 years old students?</li>
                      <li>Can you volunteer to speak to students of this age group in your local schools?</li>
                      <li>Can you help imagine1.org develop curriculum and/or get it approved for use locally?</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>If you are a professional speaker, actor, writer, minister or teacher and want to help us, please write to info@imagine1.org and let us know.
                       Thanks for your support,</p>
