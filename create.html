            imagine1.org invites you to share your personal expressions or visions of One Family with people all over the 
            world when you join, but you can do more. Think about how you can make a statement. Maybe make your own video, 
            write a poem or song, perform a skit or even a puppet show explaining why we need to live as One Family. Send it 
            to info@imagine1.org or share/post it on to the YouTube Channel or Facebook page. Be creative! Also, send us pictures 
            for the One Family Album and news you think others should hear about. Share the love!
