                <p>Ready for a One Family reunion? We are, so we are creating ways to help.</p>
                <p>First, we want to know about multicultural events in your area related to One Family. Over time, we will keep you updated on events happening in your country if you ask us to in your member profile, but please visit and help add to our calendar for now.</p>
                <p>Next, we will create a blog. For now it is simply sharing your letters, but stay tuned for the real thing. Eventually it will have rooms you can help us create, maybe a library where we can talk about books, a kitchen where we can share old family recipes, or maybe a quiet room for meditations or consoling each other. If you have any ideas for making the blog, please send them to <a href="mailto:info@imagine1.org">info@imagine1.org</a>.</p>

They want peace, prosperity, liberty, health, and purpose.

                      <li>“l.o.v.e.” Shannon Abbott (USA)</li>
                        <li> “Oneness is the direction that humanity is heading, whether we like it or not. Why not embrace the change and adopt a unity consciousness!” Charissa Barton (Canada)</li>
                        <li>“I just want to support the vision of One Family.” Brian Bennett (USA)</li>
                         <li>“What America and the world at large has become, sickens me. The filth we've become accustomed to is ridiculous. All the suffering and strife is uncalled for. The view of imagine1 is phenomenal and I will do my best to spread the word and its message.” Philip Maxwell Blank (USA)</li>
                        <li> “I believe we are all one person. We were put on this earth together to make things better. It does not matter what color or religion you are. We are all the same people, made in one image.” Savannah Hayli Brown (USA)</li>
                        <li> “Taiwan is a small island, yet has lots of beautiful places and delicious cuisine, welcome all to visit Taiwan!” Christy Chen (Taiwan)</li>
                        <li> “I believe in community, and that community and fellowship go far beyond where I live. I believe each person has something to offer, that every human being has something to teach me. I believe we can make the world a better place.” Courtney Coleman (USA)</li>
                        <li> “When discussing this idea with Scott, he made a comment which struck a chord with me...turbulent times are ripe for sowing seeds of hope.  We need such hope and positive action in our country, in our world.” Glenda Connoll (South Africa)</li>
                        <li> “I'm tired seeing the world falling apart by fighting each other for the reason that sometimes we don't understand...I'm longing for the world to become one as one family, respect each other as one family.” Adam Damili (Indonesia)</li>
                        <li> “We are all connected.  Love!  Joy!” Michelle DeAngelis (USA)</li>
                        <li> “Is there really another way to view those of us that "belong" to this world except as fellow members of this life adventure?  Struggles with oppression and poverty warp this perspective, though. Indulgence warps this perspective as well. But we're all in this together at the end of the day.  The One Family concept is noble and stirs something we all can't deny.” Judy Delph (USA)</li>
                        <li> “I live in a small country (Switzerland) with less than half the size of major cities in other parts of the world in terms of population, but speaking four different languages. Since language carries culture we need to manage cultural differencies. We do this by consensus not by war. It is not always perfect but it worked since 1291. Will share more with you if you like. “ Véra Feuerstein (Switzerland)</li>
                         “Most of us, when we were younger had pen pals, someone we wrote to on a weekly basis. We told them all the good and bad that our little lives had experienced in the week past. We waited for the day to hear from our pen pal and to read all that they had to tell. Yet we never had any discrimination towards the color of their skin, their religion, whether they were male or female, we just wanted to know about their life. I feel that a site like imagine1.org and an idea like One Family can really bring people together. Imagine1 can grow and help bring a better understanding to how life is anywhere in the world. We all need to realize we are all a click away from anyone in the world, we can make friends in others countries just as we would make friends through Myspace or Facebook. We are all in this together, we all share the same blood and the sooner we truly believe this the better off this world will be for all of us. Like this site says, take a moment to meet someone new and stop to really listen to them for who they are. We all have stories that make us who we are so share and listen so that we can all grow closer to being one family.” Tyler Alexandro Gallo (USA)</li>
                        <li> "As One Iranian Poem Said 
                                    بنی آدم اعضای یکدیگرند   که در آفرینش ز یک گوهرند
                                 چو عضوی به درد آورد روزگار   دگر عضوها را نماند قرار
                                 تو کز محنت دیگران بی غمی    نشاید که نامت نهند آدمی
                         The sons of Adam are members one of another, 
                         for in their creation they have a common origin. 
                         If the vicissitudes of fortune involve one member in pain, 
                         all the other members will feel a sympathy. 
                         Thou, who art indifferent to other men's affliction, 
                         if they call thee a man art unworthy of the name. " Hemat Morad Ghalandari (Iran)</li>
                        <li> “I support the One Family concept because we all belong to one family, a family of human beings. We share the same human values from the inside. From the outside it may seem different like the languages we speak, foods we eat, and the clothes we wear. That is mainly because of the geographical differences. All the cultures grew up differently according to their lands and what it taught them. Inherently, we are all the same and thus one family. Namaste.” Tashi Wangyal Ghale (Nepal)</li>
                        <li> “For the hopes of a better future, for me and my brothers in arms, let's get this world on the fast track for a greater understanding. Hooah Dad, stay motivated.” Landon Gray (USA)</li>
                        <li> “We are living in a small planet. There are connections among all people.” Baojun Gu (China)</li>
                        <li> “I support it because we are one family.  And I believe everyone is equal and should be treated as equals.” Brandon M. Gullett (USA)</li>
                        <li> “As I have traveled, I have seen one truth - we all are trying our best to provide for our family and make the world a better place from our point of view.  The problems come when your point of view of what is best is different than mine. Neither of us are wrong - but we are also not willing to 'lose'. With One Family, hopefully we can all understand each other better and realize that we are not really losing if we all win a little.” Andrew Hearn (USA)</li>
                        <li> “‘If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.’ - Mother Teresa.                 ‘Peace cannot be achieved through violence, it can only be attained through understanding.’ - Albert Einstein” Kristan Jacob (USA)</li>
                        <li> “If not for the sheer beauty of other cultures, we must look to one another to preserve this planet and solve the problems that condemn us as a civilization. However, I look to One Family to teach people about the wonders that come with travel and opening the mind. This joining of cultures can have both economic and environmental impact, but most importantly can have aesthetic impact on one's life and upbringing of their offspring. To truly enjoy everything and appreciate life and love in a way we thought not previously possible...” Colleen Jordan (USA)</li>
                        <li> "Scott, as a friend, I would have been one of the first ones to join ... but I took time as I wanted to share with you my thoughts about Imagine one, I like the word Imagine as it is the creative side of our mind, no one can access it and we can share or not when we want  , the dictionary says ‘’ something not perceived through the senses”…What I was afraid of or let’s say what blocked me is ‘ONE’ not because I hate to share or being together with people but human being can be so bad, a monster….towards others simply because they are different and have different beliefs, from different culture or …just being DIFFERENT and I believe in a world where people are different, from different horizons, different beliefs and they can live together. In today’s life fundamentalist made the ‘one’ thinking their vision and ideal , many people suffered and still suffer of that just simply by being different, yesterday, one of the Nazis' most-repeated political slogans was Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer' - 'One People, One Empire, One Leader'  I am just scared of this…saying that I remember the smile of my cousin Nadia and friends who paid with their life just because they wanted to be simply themselves …different …. I am concerned that anyone will interpret being ‘One’ as being the same and when I read the 5 commitments; you cannot imagine how each of them is important to remember, to me, to you, to anyone who will read them.  “Being one allows for being different people and even each person being different as they evolve during their lifetime.” This is what imagine1.org’s Five Commitments for One Family says and I support that, please forgive me if I take more space , I am not a story teller or giving lessons I just had in my mind a warning and I wanted to share it with you and while my writing enthusiasm is awake …Imagine1 can bring people from everywhere and the echo of our call could help somewhere, somehow to bring friendship across borders and make organizations, governors...human beings  see that it can happen…Imagine one, friendship across borders for freedom of choice, I feel I like it, so YES and YES, I am joining you!  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights says; article one, yiwen (one in Berber):  “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.”    And by saying that I had in mind a song,

                         Imagine there's no heaven - it's easy if you tryBut I'm not the only one
                         I hope that you will join us
                         And the world would live as one
                         Imagine no possessions - I wonder if you can?
                         Nothing to keep only from greed or hunger - a brotherhood of man
                         Imagine all the people, sharing all the world, you-hoo
                         You may say that I'm a dreamer
                         But I'm not the only one
                         I hope that you will join us
                         And the world would live as one

I think even the most evil villain in the world don't want to be a lonely soul!! haha).  Who wants to live on a planet with no one but just yourself? Who wants to live in a war zone and what you see everyday, people, even children killing people, neighbours robbing from neighbours. well at least I know in this website we all don't want to exist as A PERSON.

An idea that everyone is aware of, but few people actually live by. Knowing that the other people on this site share a common goal makes me believe more that people are capable of being more active about something, instead of just talking about.” Rachel Alexandria Leathers (USA)</li>
                        <li> “I happen to know a lot of people in imagine1.org and I also know Scott Gray, the founder. Most of the people I know in One Family are amazing human beings who live and do what they do with passion and commitment. I have met many of them and I think I can truly count many of them not as just friends but as great friends... people who I want to be with, identify with, and am not ashamed to say that I am in their family.  Imagine1.org goes beyond the usual boundaries of race, creed, colour, power, and financial gain. It rises above this and as we maintain this aim we will improve the world as we know it, we change it and we influence it. This is a fantastic source of real positive energy and power. If you meet the members of this family you will understand what I mean.” Antoine Mallia (Malta)</li>

I think this is a great movement! I will try to pass it on to others.” Whitney Moody (USA) 
                        <li> “After reading Peter Singer's "The Expanding Circle" I was awakened to the idea that our concept of "family" has in many ways expanded from our tribe to our global community. I feel that it is ever more obvious that we are a global family. Our actions have consequences that reach worldwide and our survival is dependent on our abilty to comprehend and act on this idea. Imagine1.org symbolizes, in a sense, this social movement and that is why I choose to join after hearing about it from Jane, a person who sat next to me on a flight from Minneapolis to Chicago.” Henrik Petaisto (Finland)</li>

                        <li>  "Dear Scott,
                         Looking on ""imagine1"" web page makes in me so much plans, wishes and opinion that world and all people are beautiful. Maybe it is silly to say, but I would like to do some presentations about ""imagine1"" per all around Bosnia and Herzegovina,  and Croatia, after when I finish my college. Naturally, I would do it volunteers, everything that for my soul. It is often to say that expression (for my soul) in my language. Maybe it hasn`t so much meaning in English language. But actually I would do it just because I believe that your dream about One Family can  become truth. Maybe I will do it, maybe I will not, but who knows... I will be on college 2 next year, and who knows, what kind of probability I will have when I gradute. Maybe one presentation per month just that I fill my spare time with things which makes me happy. 
                           I`m on department for communication on my college. We learn how present things for each area of human action. I`am dreamer too. Maybe I can do seminar on topic ""imagine1"" for one exam. I`m impressed by your idea about One Family. I have lot of idea in my mind in this moment, and I will do translate of your attachment, but I am so busy these days.... But I will do it for sure. And there is one thing more. Everything what I do in English I must do with glossary. But however there is happiness :-) .... I have glossary on my computer :-). Also, all will write to you what I think about your idea of On Family regarding former Yugoslavia. I think that "imagine1" can make better that region. I will write to you especially about One Family regarding my country, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Just because it is specifically country, specifically region. There is no situation like Bosnia on all around earth. It is so sad situation, but positive ideas are guide as. We have to find them and we have to keep them. I have done interview for newspaper with one artist. Maybe I have told you that.... I don`t know. Her words were like these: "Wish can become truth, just we need to want it enough.""

                        <li> “Our world is a beautiful place. It is the home to billions of people that go through their lives with closed eyes and sheltered minds. No one really understands what goes on on the other ends of the earth. But if we stop to think about it the earth is really one big home to us all that we share. We all have the same basic needs and love for our loved ones. So why not spread our love a little further? We all function the same way. We are all the same species. So many more, greater things can be accomplished if we work together and help each other out. Personally, I have always wanted to see the world from someone else's perspective and this feels like the perfect opportunity to do so. I feel like this is the true way to be able to connect with the other half the world that we never get to see. I hope that you are willing to accept me into this family so I too can help promote the unitedness that our world needs today.“ Kate Slanker (USA)</li>
                        <li> “I believe that we can achieve more together. I believe we all share common ground, unfortunately not all of us have realized it yet. I believe that we need to put aside our differences, whether they be race, religion, sex, whatever. I believe that true friendship and equality should know no bounds.” Jonathan Michael Stella (USA)</li>
                        <li> “I would like to join 'One Family' because together we can make a difference. We have all become so used to doing our own thing and ignoring what goes on around us. For example, I recently visited the Apartheid Museum here in Johannesburg and was shocked to realise what had been going on whilst I was growing up and that I wasn't aware of. We need to create awareness!” Lynne Stewart (South Africa)</li>
                        <li> “When we understand the intricate wholeness of all Life, that we are each individual expressions of the same life force, we will know that we are One. One Family is an expression of this Global Network of individual cultures, ideas, thoughts and people that represent the earths Family.  We are all children of Mother Earth.  It's time to acknowledge the truth of our similarities and honor the apparent differences without conflict. One Family is a celebration in communication of these ideas and I support it!” Brenda Strong (USA)</li>
                        <li> “When you are looking at the World from the space, this is what you will see and realize; the World is just a natural creature that looks blue, green, and white. No matter what nationalities you are, what races you are, what languages you speak, what religions you respect, or even what choices in life you make, life in the end will tell you there are no differences. Every life is urging for the same peace, the same ideal place that we can live in, the place that we can send our children to, and definitely the place without war and suffering. You may say I'm Thai, I'm American, I'm British, and etc. Still, we are all living in the same World that looks blue, green, and white. So does it matter whether which nationality you are?  And why can't we learn to live together in peace, to support each other, to embrace all the differences that make us unique? Lets forgive each other for the past because it’s the way we can enlarge our humanity’s future (Paul Boese). Heal the world; make it a better place, for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying if you care enough for the living. Make a better place for you and for me (Heal the World, Michael Jackson). Lets live the World without war and suffering, lets live as one, and to be one.” Pitchya Vajarodaya (Thailand)</li>
