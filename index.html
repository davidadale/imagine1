                    Welcome to grass-roots social change. Everything ever build was imagined first. 
                    Everything accomplished overcame skeptics who said it could not be done. Today 
                    imagine1.org wants you to envision one place in this world without borders or barriers. 
                    We want you to close your eyes, take a deep breath, and brace yourself as you transport 
                    yourself to a world where everyone you meet is in your family...One Family.
			    </p>
			    <h1>image1.org's &ldquo;One Family&rdquo;</h1>
			    <hr/>
			    <p>
                    Members do not pay anything to join One Family. They come from every corner of the world 
                    and would not normally mix, but take the five steps to ease tensions in our world. One Family 
                    is not affiliated with any institution, organization, belief system, or nation, nor denies anyone, 
                    but members share a common commitment to reunite the human family. We want the size of One Family 
                    to grow to show world leaders; we will support them when they unite us.
			    </p>
			    <p>
                    Imagine1.org's web site posts letters from members to each other about why they believe in One Family. 
                    We also have a Facebook page which allows members to share the way any family would. They can discuss, 
                    share photos, stories, favorite places to eat and to visit, and family recipes.			        
			    </p> 
			    <p>
                    So, join us now and help us grow so we can share the human treasures found in your part of the world.
