                    Grass-roots social change concepts that grow take root in a simple, undeniable truth. 
                    Because imagine1.org is about people adopting common values, its success is measure by how many people join. 
                    Why couldn't hundreds become millions, even billions who say in a collective voice, "we are one"?

			    <h1>email your friends and letters to editors</h1>
			    <hr/>
			    <p>
                    Send a note to everyone in your email, tell them why you joined, ask them to join, 
                    then ask them to send a note like yours to everyone they know. Take the time to write a 
                    letter to the editor of your local or national newspaper or magazines. It is shocking how many 
                    movements began to take root in unexpected places or ways because someone took the time to write 
                    an editor who latched onto the idea.

                <h1>facebook ad's and flyers</h1>

			    <p>
                    If you have the financial ability, create an imagine1.org advertisement on your Facebook page. 
                    You can choose the age group you want to target and the country. Also, you could take the time to make 
                    and pin-up flyers on bulletin boards everywhere you go, or make a few business cards and keep them with you 
                    so you are ready to talk to people and spread the word about One Family.
                    Spreading the word can be as simple as writing "imagine1.org" with chalk on the sidewalk, 
                    but please do not create permanent graffiti.

                    <em>If you have other ideas on how to spread the word, start a discussion on 
                    imagine1.org's Facebook group or contact <a href="mailto:josh@imagine1.org">josh@imagine1.org</a>.</em>
