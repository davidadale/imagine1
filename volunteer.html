      <h2>Volunteers Needed!</h2>
      <p>Be a part of One Family by contributing a few minutes of your time to help build our home!  All of imagine1.org started in our imagination, and came to life with a lot of careful planning and hours of hard work from our web design firm <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flow7.net">Flow7</a>.  However, we can use all the extra help we can get. Email us today at <a href="mailto:info@imagine1.org">info@imagine1.org</a> and let us know how you can help.</p>
      <h2>Translators</h2>
      <p>If you can help translate content on the imagine1.org site, please let us know by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@imagine1.org">info@imagine1.org</a>. We are building this site without taking contributions so we cannot pay you but every member who joins by reading your translation will be a part of One Family thanks to you.</p>     
      <h2>Blog Designers</h2>
      <p>We want to create a blog that is integrated into the imagine1.org (rather than joining an external blog).  We can provide functional requirements so If you can help us, weâ€™d love to see you join the team!</p>

      <h2>Ambassadors</h2>
      <p>Every day in every interaction every member of One Family can be an ambassador for change. This can be as simple as casual conversations, but to create lasting social change, we must reach our children. To get there we need help in three ways:<p>
      <ul>
      <li>Can you help us develop a presentation for 12 to 14 years old students?</li>
      <li>Can you volunteer to speak to students of this age group in your local schools?</li>
      <li>Can you help imagine1.org develop curriculum and/or get it approved for use locally?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you are a professional speaker, actor, writer, minister or teacher and want to help us, please write to <a href="mailto:info@imagine1.org">info@imagine1.org</a> and let us know.
       Thanks for your support,</p>
      <p><em>Shannon and Nadi</em></p>
