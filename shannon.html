          <h2>Shannon Abbott</h2>
          
          <p><img src="images/shannon.png" style="width:200px;padding:14px; float:left;"/>I knew the instant I met Shannon Abbott I met someone very unique.  She starts each day looking out her window at all of us, envisioning her dream: the world loving all, as family, and making new realities together. 
             Shannon is a teacher, but when she enters her classroom she is as excited about learning from her students as much as she is about exploring life's endless possibilities with them.  Teaching at a girls international boarding school opened her eyes and her heart to the possibility of all living together as one.  In her words, each student taught her the pure love of a child and the creative beauty that exists when people of diverse backgrounds come together for positive purposes. Her sincere respect for them is obvious, as she talks about the impact of their energy and insights upon her life vision.  Shannon, certified in English and history, received her Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education from Central Michigan University, and she later went to obtain certification in the International Baccalaureate (IB) Middle Years Program.
             Wherever Shannon goes, you feel her energy enter.  Bubble wrap will start popping, hummingbirds will start circling round, and rainbows will follow.  She is an inspirational leader who enjoys testing new approaches.  For instance, Shannon understands the importance of a vision statement, but believes equally in the power of a chalk stencil that says “Love 1 Family.”
             Shannon started her journey to One Family as a young girl.  Her first moment of clarity came to her when she was 12, walking home from school, thinking of a girl just like herself walking on the opposite side of the planet.  And in her imagination, a seed was planted.  A seed that begged answers for… “what is she like?”… “is she like me?”… “does she walk from school thinking about me?” This seed bloomed every time she experienced the “other girl” in her life, at a summer camp, in a classroom. Then just as she was asking for this vision to become her life’s work, she stumbled across imagine1.org on the Appalachian Trail and embraced it as a long lost family.
