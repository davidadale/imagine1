                  <h2>Vision</h2>
                  <p>imagine1.org envisions a world where expanding circles of humanity come home to the concept of imagining then embracing one another as One Family.</p>
                  <h2>Overview</h2>
                  <p>Every human creation starts in our imagination so imagine1.org is here to help an expanding circle of people, just like you, imagine, then become a part of One Family. We want to create connections between you and people everywhere, aimed at inspiring all to see we are all the same at so many basic levels. We want to help everyone begin celebrating the potential for human unity.  We want all to focus on what they share in common with others, to move beyond simply tolerating diversity, to adopt an entirely new mindset towards diversity, where we explore and embrace our differences.  With a new attitude about unity, imagine1.org will help members join projects or events to build One Family and, most importantly, to take one step each day in their daily lives to embrace someone, perhaps someone they would not normally consider embracing.  At imagine1.org, we want to inspire you as much as you inspire us, creating a continuous cycle of goodwill within a growing family, our family, One Family.</p>
                  <p>“imagine1.org is not affiliated with any institution, organization, belief system, or nation, nor denies of them, The only requirement for One Family membership is a commitment to reunite the human family as One Family. </p>

                      <h2>History</h2>
                      <p>In late 2007, after a few rounds of around-the-world travel, Scott “Nadi” Gray prepared a photo exhibit for a local coffee shop displaying his view of the world. As he prepared, he noticed that the most beautiful thing he experienced was the common life of humanity. In the pictures of a young woman daydreaming in Singapore, men playing chess in Beijing, women dancing in Barcelona, and young boy’s swimming with their dog in South Africa, Nadi remembered how he saw these images of humanity everywhere he went. He began to see how, at a very basic level, humanity, whether separated by history, culture, language, belief, or even war, had maintained a common foundation from its past. </p>

                      <p>With that, he began to yearn for a better future. Nadi went beyond the photos and penned an open letter to his American friends called “One World, My Dream.” </p>
                      <p>NOTE: A video along with the text for “One World, My Dream” is available <a href="http://youtu.be/W5dJQhoUjj4" target="_blank">here</a></p>

                      <p>Then, one evening while the exhibit was still up and Nadi was sipping coffee, an idea came to him. He responded to the idea by doing something he had never done before. He registered an Internet domain and built a very basic website to begin to show others what he saw: imagine1.org.</p> 

                      <p>In 2008 and 2009, as he traveled, he talked to people about the imagine1.org concept of One Family. These conversations proved to him that others saw what he saw, that they wanted to build what he wanted to build. Like Nadi, they could imagine a world where</p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>Families took control over governing our world’s destiny.</li>
                      <li>We confront our fear of our differences by embracing what we share in common.</li>
                      <li>A communist and a capitalist both see each other’s similarity of caring for their aging mothers without judgment based on beliefs or differences.</li>
                      <li>No matter what we believe, all want to see our children happy and healthy.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>While some rejected the idea of One Family as naive or impractical, others from 25 countries joined the little family. Some wrote to the rest about why they believed in the idea. So despite Nadi being distracted by his writing, adventures, career and family, the dream of imagine1.org’s One Family was kept alive by the all that joined. </p>
                      <p>In 2011 while backpacking on the Appalachian Trail, Nadi met Shannon Abbott. She had the same dream and agreed to help him turn the experiment into a reality. With that a new founder of imagine1.org leapt into action. Next David Dale, an IT consultant, offered to help build a new web site. Then, other friends began to help with messaging, community, and sharing encouragement in many ways.</p>
                      <p>The rest is our history to make rather than Nadi or Shannon’s to write. But if we succeed, our lives will become more beautiful. We will wake each day knowing an opportunity is there for us, through imagine1.org, to reach someone far away and create a more connected, loving world, a world where everyone you meet is family, our family, One Family.</p>
